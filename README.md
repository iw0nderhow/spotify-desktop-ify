### About

This redirects Spotify content links to the Desktop app. [Click here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RUKkflui09AybjqqHo231) to test.

- Auto-closes tab (if opened in a new tab)
- Doesn’t autoplay and interrupt your music
- Supports all content types (songs, playlists, concerts, podcasts…)
- Can still use open.spotify.com - only redirects direct content link-clicks
- Strips tracking ID in the link - for better privacy
